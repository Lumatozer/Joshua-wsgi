# Joshua-wsgi

Joshua is a wsgi made for testting purposes.

I have made it so that anyone can host files or text messages using a single repo and no setup.

Instructions:

  Linux:
  
    1. Git clone the repo using git.
    
    2. Run the wsgi.py using "Python wsgi.py" command.
    
    3. Enter the text or html you wanna show on the client side.
    
    4. Press Enter Key.
    
    5. If there were no errors then you can go to 127.0.0.1:8080 to see your website live.
    
    6. To see it using your ip address you need to port forward your pc via the router.
    
    
  Windows:
  
    1. Download the zip on the main repo page.
    
    2. Unzip and then run the start.bat file.
    
    3. A new window will open.
    
    4. Enter the text or html you wanna show on the client side.
    
    5. Press Enter Key.
    
    6. If there were no errors then you can go to 127.0.0.1:8080 to see your website live.
    
    7. To see it using your ip address you need to port forward your pc via the router.

Requirements

  1. Python

  2. Wsgiref

Thanks for testing out my wsgi.

This was made for testing purposes only and is not meant to replace wsgi's like Apache.
